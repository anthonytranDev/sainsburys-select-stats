## Build your first Luna app

It’s worth following this guide, if this is your first time using Luna. It’ll help, keep the code consistent with the _design system_ and make your app more accessible for all users.

### Prerequisites

To start we assume, you have some knowledge with the below;

- HTML/CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript
- React

Don’t worry if you haven’t ever used any UI libraries before. This tutorial is here to discuss step-by-step ways, on how to build your first Luna project.

### Tutorial

Learning Aims:

I am able to...

- **Setup a Luna project** - how to get a starting project base up and running. With both Luna packages and create-react-app
- **Apply Luna best practices** - tips on ways to utilise some of the features Luna has to offer in your React app. Such as the `@jsluna/style` and `@jsluna/react`

### End result

Goal:

- End up with a mockup of Sainsbury’s Select landing page up

Tools we’ll be using
[Note: packages needs changing for future users]

- **create-react-app** - React’s official starter pack. Here’s a guide to get that up and running

- **node-sass** - enables one to include SASS into the project - if you haven’t used any SASS before. We recommend you looking at the SASS beginners guide first - https://sass-lang.com/guide

- **@jsluna packages**
  - **@jsluna/react: ^4.0.0-alpha.0** - this Luna’s react UI library
  - **@jsluna/style: ^3.0.0-alpha.0** - contains styles that enables setting up theming and helpful utility mixins
  - **@jsluna/fonts: ^1.0.0-alpha.0** - contain different font sizes and Mary Ann fonts
  - **@jsluna/icons: ^2.0.0-alpha.0** - custom iconography used across the Sainsbury’s Group suite of products
  - **@jsluna/images: ^3.0.0-alpha.0** - all logo assets available
  - **@jsluna/labs: ^2.0.0-alpha.0** - contains components currently in alpha/beta. Plus a useful tool in helping develop new components, to bring them into the Luna design system. For this tutorial we’ll be using this package to bring in the new Luna Header

### 1) Setup

### 2) First Luna Component

Going to throw you in the deep end, as we'll be utilising the `Header` component. As the first component in our webpage.

Here the benefits of using Luna, over other UI libraries and trying to create your own UI library from scratch, becomes apparently clear.
